## Project's current progress

View

* Monopoly Board is created. It is designed to take account future game editing functionality.

## Current level of communication

* Using GroupMe to update status and notify other team members if any interface updates are
  required.

## Satisfaction with team roles

*

## Teamwork that worked well

* The view divided the work into main board/various components.

* Thing #2

## Teamwork that could be improved

* The View needs to communicate more with the Controller and Model team to connect the Frontend with
  the Backend.
  Working separately on each component makes agile development possible, but the components need to
  be connected.

* Thing #2

## Teamwork to improve next Sprint

* View is divided into two sections. Main GamePlayBoard and Various Components.
  Measuring the merge commit history for the view would be an improvement for the next sprint.
  This can be measured by counting the commit history that merged separate view components.
