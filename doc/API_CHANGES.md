#### API #1
ModelOutput

* Method changed: getGameState()

    * Why was the change made?
      * This change was included so that the model is still able to simplify its event output and still have the granularity of creating events on specific actions that are being done.

    * Major or Minor (how much they affected your team mate's code)
      * Major

    * Better or Worse (and why)
      * Better
        * As previously stated, this allows the model to keep the ModelOutput interface as the output of any event it creates, but the gamestate allows the controller to see what is actually changed.


* Method changed: getQueryIndex()

    * Why was the change made?
      * This change was included so that the controller will be able to know what place a user is asking for when a place action is being taken.

    * Major or Minor (how much they affected your team mate's code)
      * Major

    * Better or Worse (and why)
      * Better
        * This change allows the controller to implement multiple place actions easier and makes it so that the controller has to store less information permanently.
