* policy for a team member to give advance notice of missing a team meeting and work required to make up for it

* response policy (e.g., respond within 24 hours)
  * Communication should be pretty regular, with quicker responses for big
    decisions or important conversations. For important messages, be sure to   
    like/respond so the team knows you are receiving the message.
