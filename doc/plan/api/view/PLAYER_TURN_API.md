### Overview

* Uses
* Describe the API's design goals, how it provides for extension, while upholding SOLID Principles
* and the Pillars of Object-Oriented Design, to create a more expressive and flexible experience for
  other developers that encourages them to create new features.

### Classes 
* BoardView 
* Write any number of Java interface types in appropriate packages, to represent your APIs.
  
* These must be Java code files that compile and contain extensive comments to explain the purpose
  of each interface and each declared method (this basic code can be generated directly from a UML
  diagram or used to create a diagram). Include any Exceptions you plan to throw because of errors
  that might occur within these methods.
  Note, this does not require that all of these types will remain as interfaces in the final
  implementation, just that the goal is for you to focus on each type's behavior and purpose rather
  than its state.
  Note, classes may be shared by multiple APIs and their role should be described separately in
  each.
  
### Example. 
* Start coding with your API immediately by providing an example of how to solve one or
  more concrete tasks.
  
### Details. 
* Describe the API handles specific features given in the assignment specification, what
  resources it might use, how it collaborates with other APIs, and how it could be extended to
  include additional requirements (from the assignment specification or discussed by your team).
  Some APIs will be called by other APIs, but some will represent frameworks (i.e., your code
  provides the control and developers must fit into the plugin points you provide). Thus it is
  important that you describe these points in English and provide examples of their use in order to
  make it clear how to use the API to actually construct a specific game features.
  
### Considerations. 
* Describe any issues which need to be addressed or resolved before attempting to
  devise a complete design solution. Include any design decisions discussed at length (include pros
  and cons from all sides of the discussion) as well as any ambiguities, assumptions, or
  dependencies that might impact the overall program.
